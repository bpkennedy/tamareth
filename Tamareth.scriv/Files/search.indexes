            <Text># Payoff Moments
These are the coolest moments of the book. They need to be "earned" in the minds of the reader through proper foreshadowing and character/plot growth.

## Biggest
* Alokai and Runa being halves of the same powerful being, are re-combined through Alokai's magic and sacrifice into one soul which encompasses both their identities.

* During the seige of Dalga Mak, in the city proper, Alokai and Runa fully realize their romantic tension with a night of true vulnerability and intimate passion.

* Featherhound sacrifices itself on the battlefield at Dalga Mak, and Alokai is utterly devastated.

* At Geurc, Runa finally resolves to become a pursuer of Justice against the Sojuk Empire, in the name of the enslaved people from which she came from. She takes the mantle of Revolutionary Leader and sets her sights on the heart of the Empire.

## Medium
* Even though she loves and respects him, Runa strikes down Wainonen in fury after she discovers his betrayal in the city of Dalga Mak, during the seige.

* Reforging the artifact pieces enables Runa's destructive power to spectactularly devastate the standoff at Dalga Mak and largely break the seige.

* Reforging of the artifact pieces by Runa at Dalga Mak magnifies Alokai's perception of the magic touch lines, the network across which all magical reactions travel, and his awareness of the inner workings of living/non-living connections is increased to Dalai Lama level power.

## Small
* Runa in a tavern after journeying through the mountains, proves herself a capable defender of slaves, even if she is dispassionate about their cause. She unintentionally builds a following and whispered reputation.

* Alokai in a tavern uses the magic to understand strangers' relationships to each other and manipulate them into performing is desire without needing to interact directly with them.

* Alokai is able to view Runa's skirmishes against Empire troops from across great world distances as if watching a distant light show.

* Runa uses her control of magic to project streams of fire against an oppressive patrol of Empire soldiers that are getting violent in a slave village.</Text>

            <Text>The Empire is the political force that dominates the world of Tamereth, although there remains some native-led regions of the world. It is older than antiquety with a storied past, but for the last several generations it has been expanding its reach by conquering new lands. It has grown big enough that food production is relegated to specific areas of the empire so that the military can use scorch and burn tactics.

The Empire has a reputation. Inside, as a citizen of Empire, some may never witness the terrors that the Empire acts on others, as those are mostly along the border areas that touch unconquered lands. Those citizens love and praise the Empire for it's provision and protection - with hearts full of pride for their strong country. Other citizens are more exposed to the current war or it's recently conquered peoples near the North of Empire have a much darker view of their overlords - and see them as merciless tyrants. In those regions of the Empire, the Emperor's men must rule with a harder fist to squelch potential uprising and lead with cold determination.

In the last several years, the Empire has struggled with the nearest Northern region in war - unable to make much ground without losing it. The Northern peoples are strong and fight with preternatural reflexes, the most accomplished of any warriors the Empire has faced before. However, where they excel at man-to-man combat they lack in war-like technology and are starting to lose ground to the Empire's new war machines.

            <Title>Planetary classifications</Title>
            <Text>Planetary classifications

Class A, B and C 
Typically small, young planets whose class depends on their age and solidity of their cores.

Class D 
Class D objects are planetoids like asteroids and some moons. Regula, the site of the underground second stage of the Genesis experiment in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, is a Class D planetoid. The USS Voyager also encountered Class D planets in the Delta Quadrant, one in the Star Trek: Voyager episode "Gravity" and one in the episode "Emanations".

Class E, F and G 
Typically, Proto-Earth-sized planets whose class depends on their age and solidity of their cores.

Class H 
Class H planets appear in the series as harsh desert worlds. The planet Tau Cygna V visited by the USS Enterprise-D in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode "The Ensigns of Command" was designated as a Class H world.

Class I 
Class of gas giant, larger than Class J, and smaller than Class S and T.

Class J and T 
Class J and Class T planets are gas giants. Class J are smaller than Class T which are considered "super", or "ultra", gas giants. In the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode "Starship Down", the USS Defiant enters the atmosphere of a Class J gas giant to rescue the crew of a Karemman ship attacked by the Jem'Hadar. The USS Voyager encounters a Class T Super-Giant in the Delta Quadrant with "radiogenic" rings in the Voyager episode "Good Shepherd".

Class K 
Class K planets are barren worlds with no native life. However, through terraforming, they can be made into Class M worlds. In the original Star Trek series episode "I, Mudd", the planet Mudd was designated in dialogue as Class K.

Class L 
Class L planets are barely habitable worlds with primitive ecosystems. In "The Chase", the planet Indri VIII is indicated in dialogue as Class L. In "The 37s", the planet on which Amelia Earhart and others are stranded is a Class L planet with an oxygen–argon atmosphere. In "Muse", the planet on which B'Elanna Torres' shuttle crash lands is described as a Class L planet, which also supports Bronze Age humanoid life. In "Timeless", the USS Voyager' crashes into a Class L planet with an arctic climate. In "The Ascent", Quark and Odo crash-land on a desolate Class L planet.

Class N 
Class N planets have a reducing environment and are barren and rocky with extremely high surface temperatures caused by thick atmospheres containing carbon dioxide and corrosive sulfides. In "Night Terrors", Class N environments were mentioned as the ideal places to use oxidizer-free explosives. The Tholian are said to have come from an N Class planet in the Star Trek: The Lost Era book The Sundred. The game Star Trek: The Next Generation - A Final Unity mentions that Class N planets are more related to Class M with the key difference being a higher ratio of water to land.

Class O and P 
Planets covered almost completely with water (class O), or water–ice (Class P).

Class Q 
Planets with continually changing environments caused by peculiar orbits, an orbit around a variable output star, or some other factor which causes conditions to drastically change over time.

Class R 
A rogue planetary body, which is one that does not orbit a star but drifts freely in space. However, not all rogue planets are classified as Class R; for instance, in Star Trek: Deep Space 9 episode "The Search", the Founders homeworld in the Omarion Nebula is referred to as a "rogue" Class M planet. But this is probably a rare situation as most planets that don't belong to a star system would not be able to support life.

Class S 
Class of gas giant smaller than Class T and the next larger size up from Class I.

Class T 
The largest class of gas giant. Smaller gas giants are, in order of decreasing size, Class S, I, and finally J.

Class Y 
Class Y planets are referred to as "Demon" worlds, where surface conditions do not fall into any other recognized category. Such worlds are usually hostile and lethal to humanoid life. If life develops on these worlds they usually take on many bizarre forms, like living crystal or rock, liquid or gaseous physical states, or incorporeal, dimensional, or energy-based states. In the series, examples of Class Y "Demon" planets include Tholia, the "Silver Blood" planet discovered by the USS Voyager in the Delta Quadrant in the episode "Demon" and later mentioned in "Course: Oblivion", and the home world of the incorporeal Medusans.

Class X and Z 
Reserved for other designations of "demon" planets.</Text>

Culture
Mannerisms

Cuisine

History
(Everyone comes from somewhere.  People just don’t up and appear on islands and such.  I mean, even Native Americans walked across a land bridge way back in the day. Europeans came from Romans and Greeks and Celts and Gauls and more.  Very few people bother to look at this aspect of world-building, and they really should.  Even if a civilization has been around for two thousand years and are elven dragon riders, they came from somewhere.  Even if their mythology says they crawled out of the earth: they came from somewhere.  Examine it!)

            <Title>2 salt of tamereth</Title>
            <Text>Runa slipped the shovel into the top of the salt pile and lifted with her legs. The white granules dully sparkled in the afternoon sun as she walked out along the dormant crop rows. The muscles in her forearms and shoulders were taut and steady. She balanced the shovel alongside her body.

The ground was barren and dark but soft. It had been recently cultivated, maybe a season or two earlier. The rich scent of damp soil was barely noticeable beyond the overpowering stench of salt. It was litered on the ground like a thin blanket. Runa plodded mechanically to the end of the row where the soil was clear and carefully poured the salt over it.

She heard a voice a few rows distance say aloud, "Mind the shovel, now."

Runa didn't need to glance up but she did anyway. She knew it was Hoeg instructing the new girl who'd arrived yesterday. She would be lucky to last the month. As Runa returned for the next shovel of salt, she heard Hoeg continue his low talk to the girl.

"You hold it straight, see?" There was a pause. "Aye, now, tighten up along the handle."

She heard the girl's soft, scared voice barely above a whisper, "Like this?"

There was no reply. She suspected Hoeg had quietly nodded as he usually did. Runa approached the back of the salt wagon as two gangly young men were quietly forming small hills of salt from the back of the wagon to the front, within her reach. They had adolescent wisps of hair on their chins that wouldn't quite grow together into a beard, and their hair was a tangled mess of black. Unfamiliar people usually missed that they were twins.

"About another 10 minutes today, and we're done." Torj whispered. Runa nodded without looking up. She heard his brother Riki add, "If the boss doesn't lose her damn mind today."

"Shutup, you fool!" Torj replied. She heard a quick jostle and crunch of salt as Torj put his boot to his brother's hip. Runa ignored it and drove her handle into the pile smoothly, grabbed another shovel full, and wandered back to her row.

The girl was walking across her path. She was petite and smooth faced, only a few years younger than Runa. Her chopped dark hair still had the mostly clean sheen of one who wasn't born into slavery for the Empire but was brought into it. Her clothes were the same rags as everyone else's but there wasn't the same dirt stains on her arms and neck yet.

Runa guessed she had been a peasant from the most recent military target, the town of Vahky. She'd need to learn quite a different skill set to survive now. "Watch yourself," she growled.

The girl was startled and winced away from her. Runa could see the vulnerability in her eyes. She internally shook her head. That would need to change. Hoeg was not far behind the girl and gave Runa a quizzical look to which she returned a huff and flexed her nostrils.

Hoeg was older than the rest of them, including herself, but he wasn't yet an old man. There was only the hint of a wrinkle around his eyes, and the gray had only just started to sprinkle around his short hair. His arms were laced with scratches and scrapes from work, and his face was dusty and dry. His skin looked as though it might crack if you pulled too hard. Hoeg had been in the group the longest except for herself.

The three of them marched out to the edges of the salt and delivered more onto the ground. It would have been a silent affair except for the sounds of clashing steel, shouted orders, and the rumble of large wheeled war machines coming from beyond the hills in front of them.

Snakes of gray-black smoke curled from various points. Runa had grown accustomed to the smell of burnt oil, wood, flesh, and iron. The catapults rhythmic launching of flaming ingots was a grating boom that occasionally synchronized with the beat of her heart. The spheres would occasionally crest the horizon, briefly flailing with orange rage, and disappear further afield.

As she slung the last of the salt onto the field, Runa took a moment to pause and survey their progress. This field was nearly done. The white poison would ensure that nothing ever grew here again. She felt a pang of sadness that she instantly banished. She was too tired, and there was no hope for anyone in this land. Be it in battle or in bondage, they all fall.

A familiar horn blast sounded from behind them, and a long haired figure on a horse galloped up near the wagon. "Pack it up, you dogs," the slavemaster shouted.

Torj and Riki were nearly prostrate on the floor of the wagon, as she addressed them and everyone else in a sweeping semi-circle. Her horse was adorned with dull armor along it's neck, back, and hindquarters. The woman herself was strapped into leather armored coverings more suitable for a warrior than a slavemaster.

It made sense, Runa thought as she took her place in the single file line they formed before her, she had come from the ranks after their last master was slain during a well-timed Tunen foray last week. It explained all the ridiculous ceremony she demanded.

The new girl struggled to appear calm, but Runa could see the knuckles of her hand white from clasping her pant leg. Master dismounted her horse in a fluid motion. Her legs and arms were powerful, even more-so than Runa's. She walked with a wide, sure gait and held her back straight. Her deep set blue eyes and evenly cut blonde hair gave her a distinctly proud demeanor.

But the smirking curl of her lip and the cold intensity of her gaze told the real story. She removed the shackles from her horse's saddlebags and tossed each one to the group. Torj and Riki fumbled for theirs. Hoeg caught his easily. The new girl didn't react fast enough, and the thick, iron cuffs clipped her temple above her left eye. A thin, bloody line was visible as the girl sucked in her breath and retrieved them from the ground.

The others squinted and remained uncomfortably still. Hoeg managed a brief glance at the new girl and Runa could see him hiding his anger. The master let her gaze linger briefly on Runa. Her eyes were sparkling with something that disgusted Runa. It was giddiness. The slavemaster was enjoying this, and at the same time was goading them.

She threw the Runa's cuffs sharply at her face, but Runa caught them with one hand. The rusted metal painfully pinched her palm and the second cuff swung around it's chain links slicing the back of her hand, but she didn't flinch. She set her eyes solidly on the slavemaster's. The woman's smirk twitched, and her expression slowly turned into irritation. She turned back to the group.

"Get them on," she commanded as she mounted the steed again, "and let's move."

Runa latched hers around her wrists and took her position at the head of the wagon pole. It was a long thick wooden trunk with hewn pegs at even spaces along the trunk for slaves to clasp and push with. Torj and Riki tried to lend the new girl a hand, as she was unsteady on her feet. The cut on her temple had leaked blood over her eye, and she was wiping it out of her face, smearing the red around her cheek and hair.

"No!" Master shouted from the horse, "she'll live. Get this wagon moving now." The two young men froze and slowly backed away from the girl. They stared at the ground with their heads down, taking their positions at the wagon. Runa noticed Hoeg had already anticipated and was already in position behind her.

The new girl was shivering, and she wiped at the blood, but she trudged to the wagon and grasped the peg directly beside Runa. She looked briefly at her, and there was pain, hopelessness, and anger in her face. Runa swallowed hard and looked forward, toward their task.

Master rode behind the wagon as they turned it and pushed it back through the salted crop field. The wooden wheels tumbled and groaned along the pinion. Runa focused on her hands and arms, keeping the muscles taut and engaged as they pushed. It wasn't the effort that tired a body, it was the ebb and flow of resistence. It was the starting and stopping, the hope and despair. To be continuous, that was the only way to maintain and avoid disappointment.

As they passed from the crop field, the wagon wheels turned easier on top of smoother terrain. Barren, flat soil stretched before them. The ground was scattered sparsely with withered shrubs and clumps of brown grass between vast stretches of empty space. Some of that space had huge gouges in the earth and old barricades of dirt packed into now-abandoned trenches, encampments, and levies.

One of them was still populated with a collection of large rope and leather tents. Cookfires were built in tight proximity in the center of the camp, and Sojuk soldiers were about their business of their evening meal. A patrol of them, twelve in all and doned with light armor, were being led by a Cavalier in a thick metal armor plate around his torso and a broad sword strapped over his back. The dust was pluming up around them as they marched in loose formation around the wide perimeter of the camp.

Runa noticed a speck of blood drop onto the light wood grain of the wagon pole she was holding. She glanced up at the new girl and saw the blood was coming down quickly, a trail led down to her chin where the drops were flinging with the movement of her struggle to push.

"Ease up a little," she said quietly.

The girl seemed to wake from a fog and looked over at her with surprise. "Huh?"

"Stop pushing so hard. You don't add much to us anyway. No need to shove the blood right out of your head," she said.

The girl looked away at her feet and Runa felt her stop pushing as hard. They were nearly at camp. "Am I going to die here?" she suddenly asked. The girl's voice was quiet but choked. Runa saw that her eyes were welling up with tears.

Runa frowned and stared forward through the noisy camp, "Probably."

"We'll cut some cloth and bandage your head when we return, Alma. You will be fine," Hoeg asserted gruffly from behind Runa.  Runa could hear the disapproval in his voice.

Alma sniffled once, took in a centering breath, and promptly wiped the her eyes and cheeks. Little trails of clean skin now smeared together in a mixture of dust, dirt, and tears. Except for the grime and dirt, the girl was beautiful in a quaint way, probably the envy of many nearby farm hands. Her hair used to be silken and straight, flowing brown - now chopped at the ears and tangled with small knots. Her neck was thin, long, and delicate like her cheeks and nose.

In truth, Runa thought, Alma should worry more about probing hands. She glanced around at the male soldiers squatting or standing over their cook fires. Many of them were still wearing armor and fresh from the field. The wounded would be tended up near the sick tent at the end of camp furthest from the front line.

A few of them smiled cruelly as they passed, while most simply stared down at their meal or steadily into their fires. Of those who did stare, Runa clenched her teeth as some of them licked their lips and eyed her and Alma up and down.

The group finally arrived at the slave quarters, a tight fenced encampment of a few buildings for sleeping, eating, and privy needs. Master trotted to the front and issued a few short orders to the gatemen who opened the double doors by removing a large log from the latch. She sat calmly on her mount watching with a half smile on her face as Runa and her fellow slaves shoved the wagon into it’s berth adjacent to the fencing and heaved sighs of relief as they released their positions.

Master dismounted and one-by-one unshackled the group, while one of the gate guards lugged a satchel of grain and several jugs of water inside the enclosure for their dinner. She did Runa last, twisting the iron braces viciously to more easily reach with the key. Runa gritted but remained neutral.

After she was done she sauntered to the gate without a word and the heavy thud of the log could be heard dropping into place as the gates closed. Torj and Riki visibly relaxed and started shaking out the soreness in their arms and shoulders. Hoeg was already at Alma’s side commanding her attention as he assessed the wound on her face.

Runa pursed her lips and retrieved the sack of grain, walking it into the meal shack. She called out of the open doorway as she gathered the bowls off of the rickety table in the center of the small room. “Get the water, Torj. Riki, fetch some wood for the fire.”

Outside, she could hear Hoeg speaking. “…pretty easy to get infected out here. You’re better off tying something around your head. Come, we’ll take some fabric from one of the blankets.”

“Better not be my blanket!” Runa shouted to them as used a stick to dig and shove grey ashes around the cookware area that had been carved into the floor of the shack and lined with brown rocks. There was no response as they both left earshot, into the sleeping quarters.

Torj huffed into the room and hefted the water jugs onto the table. Runa tossed him a warped wooden bowl. He caught it gratefully and poured a half measure of water from which he drank carefully and completely. The jostling of sticks and crunch of feet signaled Riki’s arrival. He came through the doorway and dropped the wood next to the pit, immediately taking a place beside his brother who was already pouring him a bowl.

Runa arranged the tinder and after a few minutes of rigorously working the flint, a tiny flame fizzled to life and began slowly growing. “You’re up,” Riki muttered to Torj who was starting to doze with his back against the shack wall.

He came to and took over growing the fire as Runa stepped outside for a few breaths of cooler air. The sun was setting beyond distant hills and the temperature was cooling down substantially, as if cool fingers were soothing her arms and neck. The deep orange glow of the fading sun cast long shadows of pikes, the haphazerd wooden walls of the enclosure, the tall scout towers that could be seen at the corners of the Empire’s forward battalion.

Alma and Hoeg had returned and the girl had a neatly cut piece of cloth in her hands. “We’ll need to rinse out the wound before we put this on. Afraid you have a likelyhood of infection even from the cloth - Talo knows how long it’s gone without a wash. But it’s better than leaving it open.”

Alma glanced briefly at Runa but continued walking with Hoeg into the meal shack. Runa was about to return but a sensation prickled along her back and up her neck making her think someone was nearby or watching her. It was akin to a breeze, but the wind wasn’t blowing. She tensed her body and looked around alert, but there was nothing save the mumble of distant soldiers talking over their fires, the clank and groan of other wagon wheels crunching over the dry ground, and the distant howl of the featherhounds crooning to each other from the jutting peaks of the Scythe.

She often found herself staring at the the Scythe, and tonight was no different. Those mountains were like giant iron sentinels warding off those who would presume to travel them. Their tips seemed to launch right into the sky and on misty days disappear entirely above the clouds. It was as though Tamareth itself had created a wall, meant to protect the Tunen Realm from the Empire. Or to trap them.

Runa huffed and returned to the shack. She took over the fire and prepared the grain in boiling water. Alma, wound cleaned with water, now had the cloth tied around her head and was sitting at the table. Hoeg had finished his water and was sitting on the ground in the corner leaning his head back, almost asleep.

Torj took out a small dark bottle from somewhere behind him and set it on the table in front of Alma. “For the pain,” He said.

“Whiskey? Where’d you find that?” Riki asked immediately. Runa was impressed, as well.

“I stumbled into an idle cookfire on the way to the fields this morning, and suddenly this bottle was in the back of my pants, honestly,” he replied with a crooked smile.

“You kept that hidden the entire day?” Runa asked.

Riki chuckled, “Well, if you’d have gotten closer you’d have smelled how well he kept it hidden. Half of it is gone.”

Hoeg shook his head reprovingly. “You’re playing a dangerous game. Master catches you with this and you’re likely to get a lot of pain.”

Torj dismissed the comment and shrugged, “It’s pain anyway, Hoeg. I’d rather die with a little fire in my gut.”

Alma picked up the bottle and took a quick swig from it. Her face contorted slightly with the burn as she swallowed it down, but she thanked Torj quietly and handed it back to him.

The pot of oatmeal was bubbling as Runa removed it from the flames. She spooned portions into each bowl and handed them out. Hoeg came to the table as Runa was sitting down. Torj and Riki began to eat right away, tilting their bowls back to their mouths. Hoeg cleared his throat loudly, causing them to pause and roll their eyes. He prayed, “Talo, Divine One, nourish us that suffer and provide hope for the hopeless.”

“…also bring me a pony for midwinter’s day, and lots of sweet rolls,” Riki chuckled.

Hoeg scowled and focused on eating his meal. Runa payed no mind and ate, but Alma eyed the food cautiously. Not, Runa imagined, for mistrust of it’s effects but more on it’s appearance. It was a gray, gellatinous muck, hardly appetizing to even those who were starving. She quietly regarded Hoeg and asked, “Is Talo your god?”

“Talo is the one god, the only. He is the god of my people in the west, off the isles of Manua,” Hoeg replied solemnly.

Alma nodded slowly, “Manua is a long way from here.”

Hoeg looked into his bowl as he ate, “It has been a long journey.”

The finished their meal in silence and each in turn sat back against the shack walls as the glow outside the doorway faded into darkness and the glow from the fire cast shadows across the room.

Runa heard the gate swing open and the booted tread of soldiers. She sat up straighter in her seat and positioned her feet squarely onto the floor. Torj, Riki, and Hoeg looked startled but quickly hid it as best they could. Only Alma seemed to be unaware as to what was happening.

There was gruff laughter shared between the soldiers as they stepped into the doorway of the shack. Runa could smell campfire and whiskey reeking from their breaths as one sputtered, “Hear you lot have some new lass helping with the salt. Thought we’d show her around the camp.”

It only took a moment for Alma to realize her situation and then panic and utter fear rose on her face. Her hands shook as she grasped the table.

He could barely contain himself from laughing, while his drunken partner made no effort to restrain himself and guffawed. “Come on, you. Let’s have a look.”

One of them walked behind Torj and Riki and was reaching to grab her arm. Hoeg was one his feet in a split second and his elbow connected solidly with the soldier’s temple, sending him stumbling backwards.

“Hey!” The other soldier shouted, reaching for the short sword in his scabbard. Runa was over the table and flung her legs into the soldier’s chest. He smashed back into the wall of shack, shaking the small structure violently. While he clutched his chest and tried to regain the wind that had been knocked out of him, she kneed him in the groin and threw him out of the shack. She gripped the soldier that Hoeg stunned in a choke hold and backed out of the shack with him so that it was just her and the two soldiers in the enclosure yard. She knew how this would end, and it would be better to keep the punishment isolated to as few of their number as possible.

Hoeg tried to assist her, but the warning in her eyes made him pause even as he silently argued back with his own. The guards at the gate had signaled for nearby help and now rushed to the source of the commotion. Runa released and shoved the soldier into his partner. The gatesmen didn’t stop to ask questions, and Runa didn’t attempt to resist them. They matter-of-factly pulled out their short clubs and struck her. The clubs connected with her stomach, shoulder, and head. One gripped her by the cloth shirt and spun her, tearing it half off while the other battered her with the club. The world spun in blur and she found herself on the ground a moment later. She felt a sharp snap in one of her ribs as a kick lanced into her side, the booted toe cracking a rib.

The pain was fire around her body, but she clenched her teeth. The worst of it was over now, as the two drunken soldiers got shakily to their feet. One of them tended to what was most likely a broken nose from Hoeg, and the other, having finally regained his breath, glared at Runa and gave her a frustrated kick albeit ineffectual due to his intoxication. He decided the evening wasn’t worth the trouble and they both walked out of the enclosure and back to their fires.

The gatesmen left Runa on the ground without a word and returned to their post, replacing the log over the gate. After they were gone, Torj, Riki, and Hoeg came quickly out of the shack and helped her into the sleeping quarters, checking her for broken bones and doing what they could to be gentle. Alma came with them looking pale-faced and teary-eyed.

As they set her on one of the bedding piles, Alma blurted in a shocked voice, “Did they do that to your back?” On Runa’s back she could see small black stones almost as pure in color as a gem. Some were the size of a pebble and a few were as large as an egg. It seemed as if they had been thrown into her back where they remained sunken halfway into the skin, but there was no blood or red scar. The skin seemed to come to each edge of the stones as if they might be decorative in some strange otherworldly culture. The fading evening light reflected off of some of the stones surfaces briefly as Runa lay.

“No,” she replied curtly, pulling the hanging part of her shirt to cover her back.

There wasn’t much talking for the rest of the evening, and Runa remembered very little as the pain swelled. She watched the ceiling of the sleep quarters change shades as the light went completely out. The glow of the fire from the meal room flickered, and she could hear the low, worried voices of Torj and Hoeg talking.

The last thing she remembered was imagining that the pain was going away, the ribs in her side were weaving back together, the bruises and cuts were rapidly healing, and one of the featherhounds had ventured curiously far from the Scythe and was pacing around just outside of the Empire’s war camp.

            <Text>The world of Tamereth is crumbling as its peoples cope with disasters, political corruption, and mysterious magical events.

Runa, a young salt shoveler slave for the Tjorn Empire, is saved by a piece of an amulet as her regiment is destroyed while across the sea Alokai, apprentice engineer in a border village, discovers the corresponding piece of the same amulet but fails to warn the village's residents before a magical tremor swallows them into the ground.

As Runa grows in reputation and Alokai in knowledge (both in power), they are drawn to the great city of Nurn where Alokai loses his piece of the amulet during an Empire/Rebel battle to Runa, and Runa forges the amulet whole making her even more formidable.

With lore from the world, more power, and confessions from Companions Alokai and Runa regain their memories of who they are and confont each other in the Citadel of the Empire where Alokai fails to prevent Runa from usurping the seat of power, and she consolidates rulership over the world.

As magical disasters close in on the Citadel, Alokai learns that he can use the last of his power to transfer his knowledge to Runa, opening her mind to a more unifying perspective but also sacrificing himself in the process.

With the magical power imbalance neutralized, the magic of the land calms and their Tales are spread back across the world, magically embellished with lessons and feelings that sink into the people which is how the Hero returns to his home, finishing the journey.</Text>
            <Notes>Step 2) Take another hour and expand that sentence to a full paragraph describing the story setup, major disasters, and ending of the novel. This is the analog of the second stage of the snowflake. I like to structure a story as "three disasters plus an ending". Each of the disasters takes a quarter of the book to develop and the ending takes the final quarter. I don't know if this is the ideal structure, it's just my personal taste.
If you believe in the Three-Act structure, then the first disaster corresponds to the end of Act 1. The second disaster is the mid-point of Act 2. The third disaster is the end of Act 2, and forces Act 3 which wraps things up. It is OK to have the first disaster be caused by external circumstances, but I think that the second and third disasters should be caused by the protagonist's attempts to "fix things". Things just get worse and worse.
You can also use this paragraph in your proposal. Ideally, your paragraph will have about five sentences. One sentence to give me the backdrop and story setup. Then one sentence each for your three disasters. Then one more sentence to tell the ending. If this sounds suspiciously like back-cover copy, it's because . . . that's what it is and that's where it's going to appear someday.</Notes>

I used to write either one or two pages per chapter, and I started each chapter on a new page. Then I just printed it all out and put it in a loose-leaf notebook, so I could easily swap chapters around later or revise chapters without messing up the others. This process usually took me a week and the end result was a massive 50-page printed document that I would revise in red ink as I wrote the first draft. All my good ideas when I woke up in the morning got hand-written in the margins of this document. This, by the way, is a rather painless way of writing that dreaded detailed synopsis that all writers seem to hate. But it's actually fun to develop, if you have done steps (1) through (8) first. When I did this step, I never showed this synopsis to anyone, least of all to an editor -- it was for me alone. I liked to think of it as the prototype first draft. Imagine writing a first draft in a week! Yes, you can do it and it's well worth the time. But I'll be honest, I don't feel like I need this step anymore, so I don't do it now.</Notes>

Common personality traits
Shared personality traits of a species are usually generalisations. Personality traits could develop as result of environmental factors or through genetics. If your species is separated into distinct groups geographically, this may result in clans or tribes having different personality traits depending on experience, interaction with local ecosystems and other environmental influences.

Physical characteristics
This characteristic is often best visualised through graphic art but not all writers can draw. The written physical description you provide for your species should include the shared characteristics between all clans or tribes no matter the location. If your species is subject to a varied physical form depending on genetics or environmental factors, you may want to create a list of the different physical attributes and the reasons. Consider including a traditional dress or ceremonial dress as part of the physical description.

Subspecies
Clans and tribes are usually differentiated by location. Each location will have different environmental factors that could trigger inter-racial differences: physical, emotional and intelligent. Consider how your clans and tribes communicate, have there been any racial customs that may have been adopted by other clans of the same species through marriage, trade relations or invasion? What are the cultural or physical differences between each clan or tribe?

Alignment
The alignment characteristic has its origins in role-play games. It helps to define the general demeanour of a species as good, bad or indifferent. Looking at the history of your species and its accomplishments can help to determine its general alignment.

Relations &amp; allegiances with other species
How does the species view and interact with, other species. What relationships do they have with other sentient or sapient lifeforms? How has this effected their society?

Social customs
What social customs do they have?

Homeland
What does their homeland look like? What are its characteristics? If you species has migrated across your fantasy world, consider showing the origins of your species on your world map. You may want to include the path(s) of migration as well as the current civilisations.

Religion
What are the core beliefs and values of your species? Are there divisions in your species based on religion or is the racial culture unified in its belief on origin and spirituality? Does your species worship a single Deity? Religion can have a large effect on social relations, technological advancement and social values and norms, as well as shared personality traits.

Languages
If your species is the only sentient or sapient species upon your fantasy world and it is divided into clans or tribes in different geographic regions it may have quite a diverse linguistic culture. In fantasy settings and especially in role-play games a common language shared by multiple species who co-exist together is a common characteristic. Each species may still has its own language and characters are often able to speak more than one language depending on their experience.

Common First Names
If you have constructed a Conlang for your species, you might draw common first names and surnames from its dictionary especially names that pertain to fauna and flora which could be adopted for characters. Your species religion(s) can also provide a source for first names as too can the history of your fantasy world. Popular first names may change over the course of time. Using a first name in a repetitive fashion for characters of a certain generation would mirror the use of first names in our own human culture however, it may make the story harder to convey and your readers might get confused.

Common Family Names
The origin of family names in our own societies are often derived from a position or role that a family may have within a community. The surname "Wells" for instance is thought to have been provided to families who were well diggers by trade. Surnames are not necessarily required in small populations but as a population grows it may become a requirement so that people can be told part. Sometimes a surname may also originate from the description of where a person hailed from, for instance, Alex Von Appleston might have been used to describe Alex who came from the small hamlet name Appleston.

Adventures
How adventurous are your species? Do they like to travel to find battles to fight or do thy prefer to learn new experiences? Are there religious pilgrimages that your species embarks upon or quests for the youth to take in order to enter the world as an adult?

Physical attributes
If your story or geofiction contains combat or use of physical strength then it is important to keep a note of your species's limitations. How fast can they move / run? How high can they jump? How much weight can they lift? You may want to include two sets of figures, one for averages and the other for extreme abilities.

Favoured Occupations
List the particular occupations that your species may be suited to holding within your fantasy world's society. Why is the species suited to perform the tasks associated with the position? Are there physical, mental or spiritual attributes of your species that are ideally suited to an occupation? Are the choices for the favoured occupations based on social interactions and hierarchies with other species?

Level of Advancement
A species could advance to become a super species only if the physical, spiritual and mental capabilities of your species allow it. A species without magical powers may find it difficult to advance in experience or better themselves if the world around them required the use of magical abilities. The degree of racial intelligence are also factors limiting advancement.

Civilisations
What civilisations is your species responsible for nurturing or helping to build up? What part did the species play in the civilisations creation, growth and demise? Are there any significant cultural advances that your species has helped to create?

Magical/special abilities
Not all specials will have magical/special abilities. These abilities do not have to be magical/supernatural in origin, but may be the result of scientific intervention or breeding. These abilities may have a positive or negative effect on a species. It can build them up to become powerful both politically and physically or it can cause them to become outcast. Keep a detailed list of the abilities of your species if you decide to include them. Does everyone inherit the same special abilities or are only a selection of powers inherited through genes? Do the number or strength of special abilities increase or decrease with experience and age? You might choose to restrict abilities to people who are in a certain profession or who worship a particular deity.

Famous persons
Are there any notable famous people in your species? Famous characters could be heroes or heroines of ages past or they could be influential people from the present time period, such as a politicians, magicians, teachers or bards. Famous characters don't have to be the characters that you are pivotal to your story, but their actions may have had a lasting influence on your species and its development.

Population statistics
Include the population statistics on your map for your fantasy species. The size of the population and ability to socially network with other species can influence the diversity of the culture and sub-cultures of your species.

History
The history of your species may begin prior to the your fantasy world if the species has migrated from another world or it may have begun many billions of years after your world came into existence. When you first begin fleshing out this section of your template, jotting ideas down in bullet points is good start. You can later develop these ideas as part of your world building or story.</Text>

            <Text># Runa
## Summary:
* After enduring enslavement in the Empire's ranks, a young salt shoveler discovers a magical artifact, escapes, and uses her abilities to prove her worth as she builds a revolutionary following back to the center of the Empire.
## Motivation:
* wants to bend opportunity to her best advantage regardless of the means
* wants to prove her worth to the world
* resents the world for allowing her to endure enslavement
* wants revenge against the Empire over the institution of slavery
* respects self over collective
* feels achievement from seizing opportunity from the whole
## Goal:
* flee the empire, later to free slaves and overthrow the slave-labor-based Empire
## Conflict:
* **External**:
  * slavery requires destruction/war/risk
  * Empire waging war against her
  * magical disasters befall and inhibit her progress
  * counsel from oldMentor makes her doubtful
  * love with the protagonist distracts her
* **Internal**:
  * fear of failure
  * fear of love/trust (uses achievement to prove relationships aren't needed)
## Epiphany:
* learns to love and trust people (mentor and protagonist)
* the world doesn't have to be broken or forcefully bent to enact change
* transforms from imbalanced to more balanced
## Map travel path:
Vahky &gt; Through the Scythe &gt; Koay &gt; Bellali &gt; Gulya &gt; Olmah &gt; Geurc &gt; Parin &gt; Asanan &gt; Taikto &gt; Dalga Mak &gt; Muinen &gt; Ihnis
## Character Synopsis:
Runa is coming of age as a slave in a forced labor unit of the Empire's military that shovels salt onto the conquered fields of its current enemy, the Tunen Realm. She had been a part of a Tunen region that was conquered by the Empire when she was a child and has grown into a quiet, distrustful, and hardened worker. A slavemaster with a particular reputation for cruelty, has made her life a living hell, pushing her to perform grueling tasks harder and harder or face cruel discipline.

As she and the accompanying regiment move further into Tunen territory they face significant pushback from the Tunen forces, and she discovers a fragment of a magical artifact. She escapes the battle and flees Northwest, towards The Scythe. As she travels, she begins exploring the magical capabilities of the artifact, but from a different perspective from Alokai. Runa is trying to exploit opportunity that can be used as an advantage to her in her goals, eventually as a weapon (later in the story).

She is pursued into the mountains by Empire and Tunen patrols and is also tailed by a mysterious old fisherman named Wainonen who eventually reveals himself as someone who knows about magic and agrees to journey with her through the mountains after she has some dangerous run-ins with predatory magical creatures.

When they emerge from the mountains, Runa is considerably travel and health-hardened, and is a cautious learner to Wainonen. They arrive in Koay where their journey is revealed.  In that town of digruntled Empire slaves, the local Empire magistrates learn that she has escaped, but they are unable to overcome Runa during a conflict. They are destroyed by Runa and Wainonen. In the aftermath, Runa rejects the loyalty pledges of the slaves and instead chooses to flee the Empire by traveling to the western coast port of Geurc. But word of her deeds spread and her reputation as a revolutionary begin.

They arrive at Bellali and keep a low profile, as they reprovision. Wainonen begins to advise her towards using her reputation towards her advantage, and she starts learning to use the magic to influence events in her favor. It becomes too difficult for her to resist defending the oppressed slave section of the city, and she uses her magic to free them which garners more attention and reputation to her as a revolutionary. Runa is beginning to weigh the idea of not fleeing and continuing to free slaves.

In Gulya, Runa meets travelers seeking to join her and violently rebukes them. She sees the rise of revolution and rebellion that seems to already have positioned her as its leader (without her having accepted leadership), as skirmishes between them and Empire patrols happen before her. She hurries to Geurc, hoping to abandon the Empire as quickly as possible, where she has an internal crisis before her ship to leave the continent is to depart. She decides to turn around, take the reigns of the revolution, and commit to dethroning the Emperor. While in Geurc, she meets a Tunen agent who agrees to ally with her against the Empire. She begins the journey to Dalga Mak.

Over time, and as she learns more about her magic and begins sensing Alokai in night dreams, word of her plights spread to the Empire, the Tunen Realm, and across Tamereth as a revolution. She sweeps through the empire towards the great city of Dalga Mak where she coordinates the Rebellion forces (and allied Tunen Realm forces) clashing with Empire forces. She finally meets Alokai. Here it is revealed that Wainonen is a former companion from a generation ago when her and Alokai made this quest before. He is able to explain the reason for the amulet, it's relationship to the Temple at Ihnis, and she knows she needs to go there to complete her conquest of the Empire. When Runa discovers Alokai's part in the defense of Dalga Mak from her attack, she concludes that her and Alokai's idealogies are incompatible, and she steals his piece of the artifact.

She feels her power change after possessing both broken pieces. Before the battle (days long) is complete between the three armies at Dalga Mak, she sets out for the Temple at Ihnis. At Muinen, she reforges the amulet, and her magic is further magnified. At the Temple of Ihnis, she is confronted again by Alokai and he attempts to stop her. She manages to subdue and imprison him. She takes full power and authority over the Empire in a magical ceremony/prophecy fulfillment.

The world is further collapsing and Alokai escapes his prison and sacrifices his life to grant her his power and knowledge. This succeeds in swaying her mind on her methods of ruling. It also stabilizes the magical imbalance of the world which had been spawning all sorts of magical maladies and creatures.</Text>

## Character Synopsis
Alokai is coming of age in a relatively quiet island village on the border of the Empire. He was adopted by the island's Master Builder as an orphaned child and learned the trade of drafting and planning the larger buildings and settlements of the island. His father is respected amongst the people (and also a valuable/rare trade) and is given some latitude in engaging in eccentric hobbies like mechanical engineering. While during the day Alokai assists in what he feels is boring drafts of alehouses, inns, town squares, travel road infrastructure, during the evenings he indulges in building mechanical contraptions and sketching conceptual ideas.

He discovers a piece of a mysterious artifact in a remote job site, and soon after begins feeling connections to magic. He is sometimes able to perceive the roads by which magic travels - lines of connection between living and non-living things. He gains a companion - a magical creature called a featherhound. It can speak only to Alokai. Alokai is scared and confused of his magical affinities at first, but begins to explore and experiment with his new abilities with the help and encouragement of the featherhound.

Around this time, tremors and earthquakes nearly destroy the island. Alokai is the only one who can perceive the source of the destruction as magical and against his village's wishes he sets out to inform the Empire of the coming magical destruction (of which only he can see and sense).

He determines the fastest journey to Dalga Mak is a ship to Donzul.  After evading disaster through piracy and gaining a congenial scoundrel companion he gets to the small port of Papak for resupply. Antagonistic magical creatures spawn, inhibiting their progress. The ship crashes as it rounds the bottom of the continent and they go on foot to Imis.  He aids Imis by using his engineering skills to solve a big problem.  Additionally, small confrontations between rebellion idealogies and Empire supporters interrupt their journey and require clever handling to escape. Along the way, he begins to sense Runa's growing power from a distance. He can also sense her journey's trajectory paralleling his own. They begin to interact with each other through their magical ability, and they develop a relationship.

In the great city of Dalga Mak, Runa and Alokai meet in person as forces of the Empire and Rebellion clash in a large confrontation. Here he chooses to aid the city of Dalga Mak with defenses to protect the innocent, but Runa interprets this as working for the enemy. He is betrayed by Runa and she steals his artifact which dampens his magical powers. She reforges the two pieces into one, and the magical chaos in the land increases.  However, during his time in Dalga Mak he gains a third companion - a cosmopolitan scribe. After the battle, as Alokai continues in his weakend state to the Temple at Ihnis he learns with the help of his companions that he has done this quest before in a different time, as an older version of himself, and that he did it with Runa and that they failed in their quest because their power imbalance with the world was unsustainable. This is also the reason for the pending armageddon: the imbalance.

He resolves to prevent Runa from succeeding in her quest, as her power would grow and destroy the world. He confronts her in the Temple at Ihnis as she is taking power, but he fails to stop her, but she is struggling against executing him and so imprisons him instead. She takes rulership of the Empire. He realizes that the only way to achieve balance is to destroy the artifact and sacrifice himself so that only Runa remains. His companions who escaped capture find a way to free him from prison, but he doubles back and confronts Runa a second time. This time he uses the last of his power to empty himself into her mind, losing his life in the process. He succeeds, the magic balance is restored.

## Character Synopsis
Alokai is coming of age in a relatively quiet island village on the border of the Empire. He was adopted by the island's Master Builder as an orphaned child and learned the trade of drafting and planning the larger buildings and settlements of the island. His father is respected amongst the people (and also a valuable/rare trade) and is given some latitude in engaging in eccentric hobbies like mechanical engineering. While during the day Alokai assists in what he feels is boring drafts of alehouses, inns, town squares, travel road infrastructure, during the evenings he indulges in building mechanical contraptions and sketching conceptual ideas.

He discovers a piece of a mysterious artifact in a remote job site, and soon after begins feeling connections to magic. He is sometimes able to perceive the roads by which magic travels - lines of connection between living and non-living things. He gains a companion - a magical creature called a featherhound. It can speak only to Alokai. Alokai is scared and confused of his magical affinities at first, but begins to explore and experiment with his new abilities with the help and encouragement of the featherhound.

Around this time, tremors and earthquakes nearly destroy the island. Alokai is the only one who can perceive the source of the destruction as magical and against his village's wishes he sets out to inform the Empire of the coming magical destruction (of which only he can see and sense).

He determines the fastest journey to Dalga Mak is a ship to Donzul.  After evading disaster through piracy and gaining a congenial scoundrel companion he gets to the small port of Papak for resupply. Antagonistic magical creatures spawn, inhibiting their progress. The ship crashes as it rounds the bottom of the continent and they go on foot to Imis.  He aids Imis by using his engineering skills to solve a big problem.  Additionally, small confrontations between rebellion idealogies and Empire supporters interrupt their journey and require clever handling to escape. Along the way, he begins to sense Runa's growing power from a distance. He can also sense her journey's trajectory paralleling his own. They begin to interact with each other through their magical ability, and they develop a relationship.

In the great city of Dalga Mak, Runa and Alokai meet in person as forces of the Empire and Rebellion clash in a large confrontation. Here he chooses to aid the city of Dalga Mak with defenses to protect the innocent, but Runa interprets this as working for the enemy. He is betrayed by Runa and she steals his artifact which dampens his magical powers. She reforges the two pieces into one, and the magical chaos in the land increases.  However, during his time in Dalga Mak he gains a third companion - a cosmopolitan scribe. After the battle, as Alokai continues in his weakend state to the Temple at Ihnis he learns with the help of his companions that he has done this quest before in a different time, as an older version of himself, and that he did it with Runa and that they failed in their quest because their power imbalance with the world was unsustainable. This is also the reason for the pending armageddon: the imbalance.

He resolves to prevent Runa from succeeding in her quest, as her power would grow and destroy the world. He confronts her in the Temple at Ihnis as she is taking power, but he fails to stop her, but she is struggling against executing him and so imprisons him instead. She takes rulership of the Empire. He realizes that the only way to achieve balance is to destroy the artifact and sacrifice himself so that only Runa remains. His companions who escaped capture find a way to free him from prison, but he doubles back and confronts Runa a second time. This time he uses the last of his power to empty himself into her mind, losing his life in the process. He succeeds, the magic balance is restored.</Text>

            <Notes>Step 7) Take another week and expand your character descriptions into full-fledged character charts detailing everything there is to know about each character. The standard stuff such as birthdate, description, history, motivation, goal, etc. Most importantly, how will this character change by the end of the novel? This is an expansion of your work in step (3), and it will teach you a lot about your characters. You will probably go back and revise steps (1-6) as your characters become "real" to you and begin making petulant demands on the story. This is good -- great fiction is character-driven. Take as much time as you need to do this, because you're just saving time downstream. When you have finished this process, (and it may take a full month of solid effort to get here), you have most of what you need to write a proposal. If you are a published novelist, then you can write a proposal now and sell your novel before you write it. If you're not yet published, then you'll need to write your entire novel first before you can sell it. No, that's not fair, but life isn't fair and the world of fiction writing is especially unfair.</Notes>

            <Title>1 just another builder</Title>
            <Text>"You can't put a price on a good storm trough, Uso," Alokai heard his father chuckle from the front of their workshop.

Another deep voice promptly objected, "Be that as it may, what am I going to do if I don't like it? Swim to the mainland and find another builder? You charge too much, Loto."

The two men carried on their haggling in reserved, controlled tones while Alokai sighed and returned to his work. Large sheets of parchment with finely drawn lines and marks lay stretched in odd directions across a wide wooden desk. He repositioned his chair with a purse of his lips, pressed the crisp paper between his fingers, and pulled the design towards the corner of the desk where the afternoon sun struck the table top. The warm light felt good on his fingers and glinted off of the drying black ink.

The Talnu Va'nua wooden rail network was nearly complete, and thank the gods for it. Sometimes he wished that father hadn't raised him to full apprentice last summer. The quill scratched evenly across the parchment, a thin line of black running along an ink-stained wood plane. He kept his eyes on the line, picked the rough cut wood block out of his belt and used it to mark perpendicular lines evenly spaced. Each scratch and scrape, he breathed in the ever-present oaky sawdust that shimmered in the light and smelled the lightly bitter smoke of the quill ink.

He stopped to inspect his work and heard the front door to the workshop close. A few dull thuds approached the room, and his father appeared leaning in the open door frame. He was a big, belly-over-buckle man. He wore a burlap over his legs and loosely-tied fronds around his chest and shoulders. Dark hair covered his crossed arms, calves, and bare feet. His hair was long and curly, but his face was as smooth as a child's and twice as jovial.

"Another drain, Kai," he said.

"Great," Alokai yawned, stretching his chest and glancing out the window.

"Oh, come now, I know it's no fancy empire contraption, but surely it's not that boring?" he said with a smile.

"It's fine, pa, I just wish-"

"That you could invent the most complicated thangamajig this island has ever seen?" Loto was starting to laugh now.

Alokai struggled to maintain a straight face as his father approached the drafting table, throwing his heavy arm over his shoulders, and looking down with mock-criticism at his current design. He pointed at a section of the rail line, "Maybe we can make this part go up into the air and do a wheel? Yes, they just need to pump and get enough speed up going downhill from there," he motioned towards the top of the mountain which had slightly more elevation.

Alokai chuffed and smiled, "Not enough speed."

Loto laughed. "Oh, it's speed you're worried about and not all of Galube'i calling us a pair of crazed loons? I think you may need to be demoted," he said as he took the quill and continued drawing out the rail entrance to the mine.

Alokai remained quite while his father continued the construction design. Loto's strokes were masterful, sweeping smoothly and surely along the plane. His hands held the quill delicately but moved with intention and familiar ease. It was almost like a dance, watching the quill dip into the ink, touch, and run along the paper with each stroke deft and true.

He watched his father's eyes run along the paths of his hands, back to the scribbled measurements, and fluidly onto the the next section of the design. Alokai marvelled at how the numbers just seemed to speak to his father like a language. Loto could look at a parchment full of numbers and determine what needed to be done and where it needed to go.

"This has come along nicely, Kai," his father said without taking his eyes from the parchment, "We'll be able to make the trip up to start the mine tomorrow."

Alokai grunted and wandered over to stare out of the workshop window, as his father sprinkled sand over the wet ink on the design plans. Outside the land was lush with tall grass clumped between stretches of beach sand. Thin brown trees jutted out of the grass at slanted angles, bearing patches of bulbous mulefruit underneath wide green fronds which grew so large that their sides curled underneath. The position of the sun told him it was about time for supper. It glittered over the eastern sea and split through the trees to create a multitude of shadows on the ground. A breeze brought the sea into his nose, and he breathed deep.

"Well, all done here. Run these up to the chief, will you?" Loto said.

Alokai turned to find the parchment worked into a tight roll with some string tied around it in his father's hand. "And make sure you leave enough time for yourself to pack up. We'll probably be there for a few days to get the job going."

As he was leaving the room, he idled a bit thinking how to ask what he really wanted. His father said with exaggerated resignation, "And yes, I think there'll be time this evening to continue with our secret project."

Alokai pumped his fist into the air and jogged out the workshop door. His sandals sank into the sand as he padded his way through the irregularly placed family homes that ran up the shoreline and curved inland. He couldn't help running his eyes along the exterior of the structures as he went. He noticed the rate of decay on the foundation posts was still slow. It looked like only a couple months of normal weathering had passed when they had actually put these homes up a couple years ago. That was good. The weatherproofing oil they came up with was working.

Along the shore fishermen were carrying boats on their shoulders up to a line of cleaning tables. Full nets hung by their sides as they walked, and the sharp scent of fish wafted past him. Cool breeze rolled like waves across the entire village, tussling the tops of the domes and licking up his arms. Women carried clay jars of produce or bundles of frond or wheat grains. Occasional children giggled or shouted and darted between the domed frond-topped huts.

The tribe temple was just inside the island mainland, surrounded by a wide circle of green grass. High beams jutted into the sky in cross-stitch pattern from a roof much taller than the huts. It's interior could easily fit three huts inside it. Decorative sheets with a multitude of vibrant colors were tied around each column. The language of their people covered the sheets in intricate linework and drawings. Alokai smiled as he revisited the familiar design, the joints and fittings, all the little details of the structure that he remembered from the countless evenings his father shared the work of designing it with him.

Before he could reach the temple, he heard a sharp squeel. He glanced over and saw a familiar group of leering adolescents, laughing harshly. They were behind a clump of trees, huddled around a pig that was flopping and struggling in the dirt. Alokai immediately came to a stop and instinctively looked for something to walk behind. A run-in with Mateo and his friends was the last thing he wanted today, but the sound of the pig made him squirm, and he flinched at each gyration the poor creature made.

"Hey, what is this?" He tried calling out in a firm voice. It came out lame and deflated instead.

Several of the boys spun around quickly, but when they realized it was him they visibly relaxed their shoulders and smirked. Alokai frowned and approached the tightly circled group. They seemed to smile more menacingly as he edged his way into the circle to view the crying pig.

It was on it's side trying to edge away from a bright red and yellow snake. It's back two legs were limp and dragging on the group. There were two little red dots on it's hindquarters.

"Nothing to do for it, boys. Won't last much longer," Mateo said in an even voice. He hadn't noticed Alokai yet.

Alokai swallowed and glanced away for a moment. He heard Mateo chuckle. Another squeel from the pig returned Aokai's attention to the scene. The snake calmly waited, coiled at the pig's feet. It's eyes were locked on the pig. It's tongue rythmically flapping from it's mouth. It was biding it's time. It had already won.

One of the boys wore a tree felling axe hanging in his belt. Alokai eyed it and winced again as the pig's screeched in pain. "You can't let it suffer," he said angrily.

Mateo leaned up from his crouched position and glared at Alokai. He was tall, but not tallest among his friends. However, most people noticed the size of his bare arms, shoulders, and neck before anything else. The muscles through his forearm rippled as he wiped his soot stained hands on his dirty leather apron. He smelled like iron and smoke. His dark hair was lank. The tips were wet with recent sweat and clung to the underside of his square jaw.

"Well, look who has decided to bless us with their presence: our own master builder. Don't worry. You can build a tiny hut with the bones after we are done with our lunch." Mateo said through narrow green eyes.

The other boys laughed, some of them seemed to do it more forcefully than others. Alokai made an effort to keep his breathing steady while he thought desperately for what to say next. His eyes glanced from boy to boy, with no offer of help indicated in return. Mateo spoke again before he could offer a retort, "Why don't you do the honors yourself, Foreigner?"

He swiftly withdrew the axe from his friend's belt and stretched out his massive arm, presenting it to Alokai. Underneath the raised axe the pig scraped its two front legs helplessly into the ground, trying to drag its body further away from the snake. "Take it," Mateo prompted, his expression going neutral.

"I have lived here as long as any of you," Alokai said.

"Sure, anyone can tell just by looking at your dark, hairless ass," Mateo replied.

The boys laughed, but Alokai didn't rise to it. This insult wasn't anything he hadn't heard before.

Alokai took the axe, and the boys waited. It was heavy in his hand, and had he not tightened his wrist he probably would have dropped it. The head of the axe was hardly sharp. The wooden handle was worn down, with the grain smudged throughout the bottom and top. Alokai slowly walked through the circle and stood above the pig. The snake hissed and uncoiled a bit, but he kept the pig between them. "Hold this," he handed the rolled mine plans to one of the boys.

He gulped and wrapped both hands around the axe and hiked it above his head. *Be at peace, pig. May Talo guide you to future seas.* Several things happened at once. He brought the axe down with force on the pig's neck, and the animal screamed. To his horror, it continued to scream. *Oh Talo, no!* Alokai felt his body shudder as several of the boys shouted in excitement. Without thinking, he hacked down again harder, and finally after the third time the pig was still.

Alokai dropped the axe on the ground and backed up away from the dead pig already feeling nausea rising in his throat. Mateo, who had been watching quietly with arms folded, picked it up. He walked boldly to the snake and dispatched it in a single blow. The boys practically cheered, as Mateo held the headless, twitching snake in his free hand and lifted the wood axe victoriously with the other. Mateo's toothy smile increased the bile building at the back of his mouth.

He snatched the mine designs from one of the boys, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and stumbled out of the circle. He paced onwards towards the temple in wide steps. Mateo guffawed behind him, "You did great, Uso! We'll leave the bones at your home and the snake skin. Maybe you can make us a tent!" The boys laughed louder.

Their voices faded as he neared the temple, and he was still shaking it off when he poked his head into the temple entrance. Maester Osu was sitting cross-legged over the smoking pyre in the center of the huge space. The smoke unfurled and drifted up in a steady stream to the middle of the roof where it was collected and expelled through the side pipes that led to the exterior. They allowed the smoke to exit but prevented rain from entering. Alokai remembered his father discussing the pros and cons of such a configuration.

He slipped off his sandals at the stone entrance, bowed to the pyre, and walked quietly to sit before Maester Osu. His thin limbs were comical inside his oversized, decorative leather dress with gaping sleeves. White hair was tied up out of his face and flowed down to the middle of his back. His bushy eyebrows were turned up, as if he were experiencing something pleasant, but his eyes were closed. He watched the priest's breathing rise and fall for a few moments. Then he spoke, "Maester, I have-"

"Shhhhh shhhh, Talo should like your greeting, Alokai," his low voice chided.

Alokai twisted his lips and huffed out of his nose. Snapping his head towards the pyre, he closed his eyes and gestured flippantly toward the fire. "Mercy, Divine One," he chanted, returning to face the Maester.

"There now," Maester Osu said, slowly opening his eyes and smiling, "what have we here?" He observed the rolled up parchment in Alokai's hands.

"It is the design for the mine construction in Talnu Va'nua. We also have the materials ready, and can travel tomorrow," he handed them over.

Osu gently unrolled the parchment and stretched them on the stone floor beside them. His face was pleased as he looked over the layout and measurements, materials list, the positioning of the rails, the attention to detail. As flustered as Alokai was feeling, he was briefly overcome with a curiosity for Osu's opinion on their work and paid particular attention to him as he surveyed the plans.

After a moment, he nodded and seemed satisfied. "Loto has always been a great asset to this tribe, and no-one can dispute that. Watching his work has always been a great pleasure of mine. That will be another fine project," he said, rolling back up the plans carefully.

Alokai found he'd been unconsciously holding his breath and felt some small relief. As Osu handed over the roll he asked, "Have you been learning his art? I hear he has raised you to apprentice now."

"I...I have been trying, Maester. I still have much to learn," he replied.

The Maester nodded sagely. The corners of his eyes were soft and pleasant, as he gazes into the pyre. "And is he also teaching you his habit for creating eccentricities?"

Alokai smiled to himself. "Whatever do you mean?" he asked knowingly.

Osu laughed and placed a hand on his shoulder. It was warm and firm, belying the impression a person might have looking at his gaunt appendages. "Off with you then! Be about your business and give your father my salutation."

"Thank you, Maester." Alokai said. He got hastily to his feet, made a curt bow to the pyre, and left the temple as quickly as was considered proper.

The sun was setting as he walked back home. Passing the site of the pig, he found that Mateo and his friends had left taking the animal carcasses with them. Good riddance. He forced himself to not look at the blood marks that were still on the ground where he had failed to give the pig a quick end. A small lump formed in his throat, but he stepped up his pace into a light jog and tried to focus on what would be happening once he got back home. The time passed quickly.

When he arrived at their hut, he found a neat pile of tiny bones in front of the door. Scowling, he kicked the pile out of the way and walked inside. His father called out from another room, "Kai? Grab us some food and help me with this."

Their hut was split between the workshop where they performed their jobs and their living quarters. Loto was working in the back already, and Alokai didn't want to miss any of it. He excitedly jogged to the cupboard and put some salted meat and a wheel of cheese on a small plate, popped a loaf of bread in his mouth, and grabbed a jug of clean water. Then he wobbily carried them into the back room of the workshop where he could hear the sound of a hammer clinking on something.

A variety of strangely shaped wood pieces the size of ox yolks were strewn on the floor of the small back room. They were nicely rounded on their outsides and hollow. Some of them looked like replicas of each other but in various sizes, and some of their ends were jagged from being broken. In the middle of the room was a pyre very similar to the one in the temple. 

However, instead of smoke rising there was kettle of water being boiled, and its top was covered with a domed brass lid. A hollow wooden cylinder was tarred and sealed to the top of the lid, and something his father called a 'plunger' was slowly rotating up and down which made a connected wheel spin on its own. Every few seconds the plunger would puff a small cloud of white smoke from its top which would rise up to the ceiling.

Alokai set the plate of food down on a workbench cluttered with other similar sets of plates and jugs. Odd shaped tools and pieces of metal bits were strewn around the bench top. "I think this one is working better," his father said, standing up from behind the contraption and grabbing some bread and meat. He was sweating from the heat of the fire. It was much hotter than normal cookfires.

While his father ate and stared at the puffing machine, Alokai walked around it marvelling.

"One day, this will make a wagon move on it's own. All you'll have to do is keep the fire hot." Loto said between big bites, and motioned towards the stack of coal in a half-full bucket by the door. Alokai grabbed a few pieces and tossed them beneath the kettle.

"And keep filling the water, and make sure the seal doesn't break to the plunger tank, and make sure that it doesn't blow open," Alokai added absently as he inspected the machine.

His father laughed, "Yes, and those things." A few quiet moments passed while Alokai observed the puffing clouds of steam and Loto chewed. The open window in the room showed a view of the seaward side of the island, now a dim golden orange sky as the sun set.

"So, can we try it tomorrow?" Alokai asked with a grin. Loto held his gaze and swallowed some water from the jug.

"If we finish early, I don't see why not. But you pack it."

While they took turns eating their supper, they alternated stoking the coal fire and making notes on the parchment that recorded the design for their contraption. His father insisted on always keeping notes and numbers. He said it was how a good builder gets better.

            <Synopsis>Take an hour and write a one-sentence summary of your story.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Two unlikely young sorcerers chase each other into the heart of an empire to decide the fate of their world.</Text>
            <Notes>Step 1) Take an hour and write a one-sentence summary of your novel. Something like this: "A rogue physicist travels back in time to kill the apostle Paul." (This is the summary for my first novel, Transgression.) The sentence will serve you forever as a ten-second selling tool. This is the big picture, the analog of that big starting triangle in the snowflake picture.
When you later write your book proposal, this sentence should appear very early in the proposal. It's the hook that will sell your book to your editor, to your committee, to the sales force, to bookstore owners, and ultimately to readers. So make the best one you can!
Some hints on what makes a good sentence:
	•	Shorter is better. Try for fewer than 15 words.
	•	No character names, please! Better to say "a handicapped trapeze artist" than "Jane Doe".
	•	Tie together the big picture and the personal picture. Which character has the most to lose in this story? Now tell me what he or she wants to win.
	•	Read the one-line blurbs on the New York Times Bestseller list to learn how to do this. Writing a one-sentence description is an art form.</Notes>

Write a character synopsis that tells the story from the point of view of the character.

Now take a week and expand the one-page plot synopsis of the novel to a four-page synopsis. Basically, you will again be expanding each paragraph from step (4) into a full page. This is a lot of fun, because you are figuring out the high-level logic of the story and making strategic decisions. Here, you will definitely want to cycle back and fix things in the earlier steps as you gain insight into the story and new ideas whack you in the face.</Notes>

            <Notes>Step 4) By this stage, you should have a good idea of the large-scale structure of your novel, and you have only spent a day or two. Well, truthfully, you may have spent as much as a week, but it doesn't matter. If the story is broken, you know it now, rather than after investing 500 hours in a rambling first draft. So now just keep growing the story. Take several hours and expand each sentence of your summary paragraph into a full paragraph. All but the last paragraph should end in a disaster. The final paragraph should tell how the book ends.
This is a lot of fun, and at the end of the exercise, you have a pretty decent one-page skeleton of your novel. It's okay if you can't get it all onto one single-spaced page. What matters is that you are growing the ideas that will go into your story. You are expanding the conflict. You should now have a synopsis suitable for a proposal, although there is a better alternative for proposals . . .</Notes>

            <Text>Sylvahla grew up as the child of a Sojuk thane. Her parents were present and generally well meaning. Their family was well off, and close friends to the Emperor. The emperor lusted for her mother and so as the Tunen conflict drew on her father was called into service to lead troops into war. While he was away, the emperor prayed on and forced her mother to sleep with him. He arranged for her father to be on the front lines, and he fell in battle. Overcome upon hearing the news, her mother committed suicide.

Being the child of a fallen Thane, Sylvahla was taken as a ward of the Emperor. She was trained to be a soldier, and her hatred of the Tunen soldiers increased as she blamed them for everything that befell her family. Her parents voices began to talk to her and accuse the Emperor for their demise. She knew and suspected that the Emperor was somehow involved, but she took strides to not think that as he had been good to her since then. She tried to avoid the voices in her head or tell her superiors about it.

Psychosis continued to manifest, as she regularly felt hands around her neck and bugs crawling on her skin. She would see shadows in the corners of her quarters and go stamping them down.

As she was a favorite of the Emperor and many of her symptoms were non-violent and not very disruptive, she was simply observed by others as a strange but protected person. She was given leniency to be somewhat irrational.

During the Tunen conflict as she directed slaves, she was closer and closer to the triggering event from her childhood and symptoms began to manifest in new distortions of reality. She felt that her peers were watching and laughing at her. She felt a strong delusion that the Emperor was trying to kill her, but would stop if she could make him proud. Most days she spent suspicious of people around her, waiting for an assassin to strike.

She latches onto the pattern of Runa's birth scar (from the magical artifact) and is convinced that it describes the Emperor's greatest wish and if she could understand it, she would finally be free from his assassins.

It's for this reason that she will pursue Runa across the world.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Make an outline detailing the scenes that emerge from your four-page plot outline using the Scenes view to the left. Include the Point Of View character for the scene in the notes.</Synopsis>
            <Notes>Step 8) You may or may not take a hiatus here, waiting for the book to sell. At some point, you've got to actually write the novel. Before you do that, there are a couple of things you can do to make that traumatic first draft easier. The first thing to do is to take that four-page synopsis and make a list of all the scenes that you'll need to turn the story into a novel. And the easiest way to make that list is . . . with a spreadsheet.
For some reason, this is scary to a lot of writers. Oh the horror. Deal with it. You learned to use a word-processor. Spreadsheets are easier. You need to make a list of scenes, and spreadsheets were invented for making lists. If you need some tutoring, buy a book. There are a thousand out there, and one of them will work for you. It should take you less than a day to learn the itty bit you need. It'll be the most valuable day you ever spent. Do it.
Make a spreadsheet detailing the scenes that emerge from your four-page plot outline. Make just one line for each scene. In one column, list the POV character. In another (wide) column, tell what happens. If you want to get fancy, add more columns that tell you how many pages you expect to write for the scene. A spreadsheet is ideal, because you can see the whole storyline at a glance, and it's easy to move scenes around to reorder things.
My spreadsheets usually wind up being over 100 lines long, one line for each scene of the novel. As I develop the story, I make new versions of my story spreadsheet. This is incredibly valuable for analyzing a story. It can take a week to make a good spreadsheet. When you are done, you can add a new column for chapter numbers and assign a chapter to each scene.</Notes>

The character's conflict (what prevents him/her from reaching this goal?)
The character's epiphany (what will he/she learn, how will he/she change?) 
A one-paragraph summary of the character's storyline
Use the C...</Synopsis>
            <Notes>Step 3) The above gives you a high-level view of your novel. Now you need something similar for the storylines of each of your characters. Characters are the most important part of any novel, and the time you invest in designing them up front will pay off ten-fold when you start writing. For each of your major characters, take an hour and write a one-page summary sheet that tells:
	•	The character's name
	•	A one-sentence summary of the character's storyline
	•	The character's motivation (what does he/she want abstractly?)
	•	The character's goal (what does he/she want concretely?)
	•	The character's conflict (what prevents him/her from reaching this goal?)
	•	The character's epiphany (what will he/she learn, how will he/she change?
	•	A one-paragraph summary of the character's storyline

An important point: You may find that you need to go back and revise your one-sentence summary and/or your one-paragraph summary. Go ahead! This is good--it means your characters are teaching you things about your story. It's always okay at any stage of the design process to go back and revise earlier stages. In fact, it's not just okay--it's inevitable. And it's good. Any revisions you make now are revisions you won't need to make later on to a clunky 400 page manuscript.
Another important point: It doesn't have to be perfect. The purpose of each step in the design process is to advance you to the next step. Keep your forward momentum! You can always come back later and fix it when you understand the story better. You will do this too, unless you're a lot smarter than I am.</Notes>

            <Text>The old man was the only one on the ship who wasn't wet. That wasn't for lack of rain, as he leaned on his cane and stared out over the bow. The other crew were too busy with securing the rigging and adjusting the sails against the wind to notice his weathered brown garment was completely dry. But Shelton noticed.

The wind pulled the man's grey beard, but each drop of water seemed to warp around his body, leaving a sharp circle of dryness around his mud-covered boots.

Shelton wiped the rain from his face and shouted over the wind, "We pull into port at sundown. You may want to get below decks." The old man nodded without turning. He seemed to be staring intently ahead of the bow of the ship, head locked, and his body was solid and unswaying on the deck without much effort while Shelton craned his hips and thighs to keep aright against the gale.

The gusts picked up speed and the ship's boom creaked as it swung violently, taking a few of the crew tumbling across the deck. He made out more shouting through the wind. The sea was starting to pick up into high waves as the storm rolled in. He could smell fresh salt and brine.

As Shelton struggled against ropes to bring the boom around, he glanced at the old man and saw him stare at the deck and slowly turn around as if following a trail on along the boards. His eyes landed on Shelton and the others, and for a moment he looked forlorn and sad. It was a strange expression to see in the midst of the storm's panic. Shelton had no time for it, he continued pulling the boom.

A loud crunch erupted from aft with a tall plume of water. Shelton stumbled to his knees as the ship was yanked roughly to the side. The old man was suddenly in the air, clearing the rail. He twisted his body to clasp it with his hand and cane and set his feet on the outer hull. The ship started to pitch.

Shelton quickly scanned the turbulent seas for Imperial or Pirate vessels. There could be no rocks in these deep waters, so surely they were being fired on. Strange that he had heard no cannons.

Planks were coming apart at the seams, creaking and cracking. They curled or snapped as parts of the vessel were unceremoniously broken into chunks and plunged into the sea. Shelton was beyond terrified, hanging sideways onto the hull as the remnant began to rapidly sink, and for some reason he felt an urge to flee in the same direction as the old man, even while his other shipmates were leaping into the choppy tides below.

He clamored up to stand on the port hull of the fully pitched and sinking ship. The old man stood calmly as the foam and roaring waves slowly brought down the ship, and Shelton was overwhelmed with unnatural fear. But the old man directed his face in a quick circle around the hull under his feet, briefly held up his cane and stamped it onto the wood.

The portside bow ripped in one smooth movement from it's nails, tar, and struts with the old man and Shelton standing on it. For a brief moment, they were airborne but somehow standing aright as the severed section of the ship seemed to jump of it's own accord into the roaring storm, rotate of some twenty degrees and put down roughly but flat into the sea.

Shelton fell to his stomach as soon as they landed, expecting to go under, but it didn't happen. The platform floated, and the old man still stood erect. He held his can firmly against the wooden floor and stared straight ahead, the direction the ship had been sailing. 

Shelton glanced back and saw the last of the ship sink below the waves. Flotsam, debris, and bodies bobbed in the rolling waves. Some arms were waving and he could hear distant shouts carried on the winds.

"We must help them! There's room!" he shouted to the old man.

The old man turned slowly to face him. He didn't make any attempt to speak but just observed him. Shelton frowned and opened his mouth to plead again, but something about the old man halted his breath. As he stared into the wrinkled face - the pale face of any old Sojuk empire man - some significance, some weight began to creep into his mind. He was looking at someone special, someone great, and someone much older than the skin and bones before him.

It was dreams and myth, a howling instinctual reaction, that triggered every indicator in his chest and stomach. Magnitude beyond understanding. Like the old man would always be here, standing on this jagged ship piece. Like he had always existed, before the empire, before the sea, before Tamareth itself. He was as ancient as remembering itself. He was a god.

"I'm sorry," the old man's voice spoke inside Shelton's head. Although the man stood in place, Shelton felt his body suddenly wrapped, picked up, and dumped into the rushing sea. He thrashed in the water trying to remove his heavy boots and clothing, coughing and sputtering when he crested the surface again, unable to get them off. But now where the old man and floating platform had been a moment ago there was nothing.

The last thing Shelton and his crew saw was a wave the size of a mountain, curling up straight like a wall, moving with slow sureness. Before it consumed them he thought he saw the old man atop his makeshift platform, standing still and easy, cane touching firmly, staring straight ahead, rising up, over, and onward.</Text>

You can fill or color in the circles to indicate the planets in the star system. Use the inner two circles for smaller rocky planets, the larger two for gas giants. There’s plenty of room to draw in moons, comets, asteroid belts, space stations, warp points, or other important objects. Shade in the Optimum Life Zone and the Ice Line. There’s lots of room to make notes about special features, like unique resource deposits, derelict space ships, or ruins from ancient races. ________________________________

            <Text># Emperor
## Summary:
* A late-middle aged Emperor witnessed his predecessors death, and in his time now discovers that magical assassins from a generation ago have returned using his own slave labor force as a rebellion against him, and he wages war to prevent history repeating itself while desperately trying to find an explanation and solution.
## Motivation:
* re-assert control over the empire
* discover the identity of the assassins and prevent their efforts to assassinate him
## Goal:
* to have Alokai and Runa killed before they can reach the Citadel
## Conflict:
* **External**:
  * does not know where Alokai/Runa are
  * army/generals are not effective
  * slave economy is crumbling
  * magical anomolies are destroying resources
* **Internal**:
  * suspicious of everyone
  * fear of betrayal and death
## Epiphany:
* mistrust, frustration, and knowledge of the past devolves the Emperor into a paranoid-stricken shut-in.
